# Eye Tracking Application - Quit Functionality

## How to Exit the Application

The eye tracking application now provides multiple convenient ways to exit:

### Method 1: Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Press 'Q' key** - Standard quit command
- **Press 'ESC' key** - Alternative quit command

### Method 2: Window Close
- **Click the 'X' button** on the window title bar
- The application will detect the window closure and exit gracefully

### Visual Indicators
- **Top-right corner**: "Press 'Q' or ESC to quit" message
- **Startup instructions**: Clear exit instructions displayed in console
- **Console feedback**: Confirmation messages when quitting

## Key Features

✅ **Multiple Exit Methods**: Choose your preferred way to quit
✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly releases camera and cleans up resources
✅ **Visual Reminders**: Always know how to exit the application
✅ **No More Infinite Loops**: Window won't keep reopening after closure
✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Camera, audio, and OpenCV windows are properly closed

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the application normally

3. To exit, use any of these methods:
   - Press 'Q' key
   - Press 'ESC' key  
   - Close the window

The application will immediately stop camera tracking and exit cleanly.

## Technical Details

- **Window Detection**: Uses `cv2.getWindowProperty()` to detect manual window closure
- **Keyboard Handling**: Processes both 'Q' (ord 113) and ESC (ord 27) key codes
- **Resource Management**: Ensures `cap.release()`, `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`, and `pygame.mixer.quit()` are called
- **Error Prevention**: Checks for MODE_SIMULATED to avoid releasing non-existent camera resources

## Problem Solved

Previously, the application would:
- Run in an infinite loop without proper exit handling
- Keep reopening windows even after manual closure
- Make it difficult to stop camera tracking

Now, the application provides a smooth, user-friendly exit experience with multiple options and clear visual guidance.
